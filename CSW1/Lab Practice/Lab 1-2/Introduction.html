        I <b>Surbhi Tiwary</b> (12<sup>th</sup> May, 2003) am an <mark>undergrad</mark> second year CSE student, in <i>SOA, ITER</i>. I was born in <em>Biharsharif</em>, a small town in Bihar, but spent most of my growing years in  <small>Daltonganj</small>, Jharkhand, which also happens to be my hometown. I completed my schooling from Sacred Heart School, after which I moved to Ranchi for further studies. I completed my higher secondary education from JVM Shyamali, which also happens to be the school where MS Dhoni, a renowned international cricket player passed out from. My hobbies include cooking, art journaling, reading novels. I am passionate about coding and dream to be a good software engineer someday. <del>xhftj</del> <ins>agdv</ins>
